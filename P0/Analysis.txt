Complexity :  There is no while loop . 
Please note that reading the  data from csv file is not being considered  . 
To get the first and last record it takes constant time . 
So the below code's Time complexity is  O(1). Space complexity is O(n)

Complexity :  As there is are two  while loop is  each of O(n). 

Adding elements to Set is  O(1) . 
Finding the number of records in texts or calls or Set is O(1) . 
While creating the  Set, the number of elements present are tracked . 
So in constant time the  length can be printed . 
Worst case complexity of the below code is  O(n)
Space Complexity is  ie O(n)

Complexity :  Time Complexity for executing While loop is  O(n).
Adding elements to to dictionary is  O(1) .
Union of two set is O(n)

Worst case complexity of the below code is  O(n)
Space Complexity is O(n)

"""
Complexity : Time complexity of  While loop is  O(n) .
Within the While loop we are doing a regular expression Match.
The complexity depends on the length of the string In this case
the  Telephone numbers are limited to 10 to 12 characters. 
In this particular case it can be assumed to be constant as the inputs are of fixed length.
say O(K) where K is constant 

Adding elements to Set is  O(1). Union of two set is O(n)
Sorting the list is O(nlogn)
Worst case complexity of the below code is  O(nlogn)
Space Complexity is O(n)
Over time complexity is  O(n).
