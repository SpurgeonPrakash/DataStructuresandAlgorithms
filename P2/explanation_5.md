Problem 5 : Auto-complete using TRIE

 **Time complexity** : 

 Insert a word : O(n) where n is the length of the word. 

 Find a word : O(n) where n in the length of the word to be searched

Find the list of words with prefix:O(n) where n in the number of nodes in the Trie data structure matching the Prefix 

 **Space complexity** :
 Insert a word : O(n) where n is the number of Trie nodes required to represent the word  

There is some optimization achieved when there is overlap in words being added .

Find words : O(n) where n in the number of nodes in the Trie data structure .
