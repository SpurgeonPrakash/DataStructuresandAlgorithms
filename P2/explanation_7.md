# Problem 7 : Request routing in a web server using Trie


**Time Complexity** :
Insert a path: O(n) where n is length of input path.   Adding to a dictionary has O(1) time.
Find a path / subpath: O(m) where m is length of the list of path segments.

**Space Complexity**: 

Insert a path: O(n) where n is leghtn of the input path. 

Find a path /subpath : O(n) where n is length of the input path.
